To generate an app:
install the create-react-app package:
npm install create-react-app -g

Navigate to the directory to make your app and run:
create-react-app yourappname --scripts-version 1.1.5
(the scripts version on the end still uses the latest version of react
but was used in the tutorial I did to make sure the starting structure
was the same.)

If you are starting with an existing react app instead of creating your own, navigate to the app directory and run:
npm install

Start the server:
npm start
