To generate an app:
install the create-react-app package:
npm install create-react-app -g

Navigate to the directory to make your app and run:
create-react-app yourappname --scripts-version 1.1.5
(the scripts version on the end still uses the latest version of react
but was used in the tutorial I did to make sure the starting structure
was the same.)

Start the server:
npm start
